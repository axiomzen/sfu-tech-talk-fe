# SFU Tech Talk - FE

This repo is for the frontend portion of the talk. Due to time restrictions we will not be building the FE live as well. However, feel free to visit https://sfu-tech-talk-fe.herokuapp.com to follow along as the backend sets up the endpoints for the frontend to connect to.

## Project Set Up

If you would like to run this locally, you will require node v8.4 to build the project.
